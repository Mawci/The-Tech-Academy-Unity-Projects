<strong><b>Castle Conquest 2D</b></strong>
<br>This was my first 2D platformer game where I learned how to implement:
* tilemaps and ruletiles
* 2D collisions & physics 
* sprite animations & animation events
* singleton game manager
* layers, tags, and sorting layers
* audio source and using multiple audio clips

<br><strong>Finite State Machine</strong>
<br>This was a small project done to show the early pitfalls of managing state with a naive approach and how to set up a state machine.

<br><strong>Mini Solar Sytem</strong>
<br>This was a small game created to help understand child/parent relationships in the hierarchy and to begin writing scripts that add functionality.

<br><strong>Game Assignment</strong>
<br>This was my submission for a rapid game creation assignment. I quickly designed and created a game that fit the criteria of:
* There must be a win condition. Meaning, once the player has achieved a specific goal, they will be informed of their success and the game will end.
* Your game must include C# code.
